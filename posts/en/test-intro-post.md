# Welcome to My Next.js Blog!

Hello and welcome to my personal blog, built with the powerful Next.js framework! This platform is designed to be a modern, fast, and highly customizable space for sharing thoughts, technical insights, and life experiences.

## Key Features of This Blog

This blog incorporates several advanced features to provide a seamless and engaging user experience:

### 1. Multi-language Support (i18n)

The entire blog is built with internationalization in mind. You can easily switch between English and Simplified Chinese, ensuring content is accessible to a wider audience. This is implemented using Next.js's App Router and a robust middleware for language detection and redirection.

### 2. Dynamic Homepage Titles

The homepage features a dynamic title section with a captivating "typing effect" for subtitles. These titles are fully configurable and support multiple languages, making the blog feel alive and personalized.

### 3. Comprehensive Tagging System

Articles are categorized using a flexible tagging system. You can explore posts by tags on a dedicated `/tags` page, which includes a search function and a dynamic "tag cloud" for easy navigation.

### 4. Global Search Functionality

A powerful, site-wide search modal allows you to quickly find articles by title or content. It supports keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl + K) and provides real-time search results with highlighted matches.

### 5. Responsive Design & Theming

The blog is fully responsive, adapting beautifully to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops. It also includes a dark mode, with automatic system preference detection and a manual toggle, ensuring a comfortable reading experience day or night.

### 6. Code Highlighting & Math Formulas

For technical articles, code blocks are beautifully highlighted using `shiki`, supporting various programming languages. Mathematical and scientific formulas are rendered perfectly with `KaTeX`, making complex content easy to read.

### 7. Image Preview & Lazy Loading

Images are lazy-loaded to optimize performance. Clicking on an image opens a full-screen preview modal with zoom, rotation, and download functionalities, enhancing the visual experience.

## My Philosophy

This project is a testament to modern web development practices, focusing on:

- **Atomic Design Principles**: Breaking down UI into smallest, reusable components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Performance**: Optimized for speed with features like static site generation (SSG), image optimization, and lazy loading.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Intuitive navigation, smooth animations, and accessibility considerations.
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-commented code with a clear file structure.

I hope you enjoy exploring the content and the technology behind this blog. Feel free to reach out with any feedback or questions!
